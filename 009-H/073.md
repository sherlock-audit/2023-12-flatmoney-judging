# FlatcoinVault.sol#checkSkewMax function is called with error.

## Summary
`FlatcoinVault.sol#checkSkewMax` function is called with wrong parameter in the `DelayedOrder.sol#announceStableWithdraw` function.
So `FlatcoinVault.sol#checkSkewMax` will be malfunctioned.

## Vulnerability Detail
`FlatcoinVault.sol#checkSkewMax` function is the following.
```solidity
294:/// @notice Asserts that the system will not be too skewed towards longs after additional skew is added (position change).
295:/// @param _additionalSkew The additional skew added by either opening a long or closing an LP position.
    function checkSkewMax(uint256 _additionalSkew) public view {
        // check that skew is not essentially disabled
        if (skewFractionMax < type(uint256).max) {
            uint256 sizeOpenedTotal = _globalPositions.sizeOpenedTotal;

            if (stableCollateralTotal == 0) revert FlatcoinErrors.ZeroValue("stableCollateralTotal");

303:        uint256 longSkewFraction = ((sizeOpenedTotal + _additionalSkew) * 1e18) / stableCollateralTotal;

            if (longSkewFraction > skewFractionMax) revert FlatcoinErrors.MaxSkewReached(longSkewFraction);
        }
    }
```
From `L295` and `L303`, we can see that `_additionalSkew` should be the amount of collateral to be added into long positions inside the pool.
On the other hand, `DelayedOrder.sol#announceStableWithdraw` function is the following.
```solidity
    function announceStableWithdraw(
        uint256 withdrawAmount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        uint256 keeperFee
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        uint64 executableAtTime = _prepareAnnouncementOrder(keeperFee);

        IStableModule stableModule = IStableModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._STABLE_MODULE_KEY));
        uint256 lpBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(stableModule).balanceOf(msg.sender);

        if (lpBalance < withdrawAmount)
            revert FlatcoinErrors.NotEnoughBalanceForWithdraw(msg.sender, lpBalance, withdrawAmount);

        // Check that the requested minAmountOut is feasible
        {
124:        uint256 expectedAmountOut = stableModule.stableWithdrawQuote(withdrawAmount);

            if (keeperFee > expectedAmountOut) revert FlatcoinErrors.WithdrawalTooSmall(expectedAmountOut, keeperFee);

128:        expectedAmountOut -= keeperFee;

            if (expectedAmountOut < minAmountOut) revert FlatcoinErrors.HighSlippage(expectedAmountOut, minAmountOut);

132:        vault.checkSkewMax({additionalSkew: expectedAmountOut});
        }
```
Since `announceStableWithdraw` function decrease the `stableCollateralTotal` of `FlatcoinVault.sol#L303`, it should pass the amount of decreased stable collateral to `FlatcoinVault.sol#checkSkewMax` function. (See Recommendation)
But now `exepectedAmountOut` of `L132` is the amount of collateral which are refunded from pool to user.
Thus `FlatcoinVault.sol#checkSkewMax` will be malfunctioned.

## Impact
`FlatcoinVault.sol#checkSkewMax` will be malfunctioned.
That is, the system may be too skewed towards longs after redeeming stables, or redeeming stables may be failed while system is not too skewed towards longs.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the amount of stable collateral to remove as a parameter to `FlatcoinVault.sol#checkSkewMax` function and Modify `DelayedOrder.sol#announceStableWithdraw` function to pass the `stableCollateralAmount` which corresponds to `withdrawAmount`.
That is, modify `FlatcoinVault.sol#checkSkewMax` function as follows.
```solidity
--  function checkSkewMax(uint256 _additionalSkew) public view {
++  function checkSkewMax(uint256 _additionalSkew, uint256 _removedStateCollateral) public view {
        // check that skew is not essentially disabled
        if (skewFractionMax < type(uint256).max) {
            uint256 sizeOpenedTotal = _globalPositions.sizeOpenedTotal;

            if (stableCollateralTotal == 0) revert FlatcoinErrors.ZeroValue("stableCollateralTotal");

--         uint256 longSkewFraction = ((sizeOpenedTotal + _additionalSkew) * 1e18) / stableCollateralTotal;
++         uint256 longSkewFraction = ((sizeOpenedTotal + _additionalSkew) * 1e18) / (stableCollateralTotal - _removedStateCollateral);

            if (longSkewFraction > skewFractionMax) revert FlatcoinErrors.MaxSkewReached(longSkewFraction);
        }
    }
```
Then modify `DelayedOrder.sol#announceStableWithdraw` function as follows.
```solidity
    function announceStableWithdraw(
        uint256 withdrawAmount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        uint256 keeperFee
    ) external whenNotPaused {
++      uint256 stableCollateralAmount;
        ......
--          vault.checkSkewMax({additionalSkew: expectedAmountOut});
++          vault.checkSkewMax({additionalSkew: 0, removedStateCollateral: stableCollateralAmount});
        ......
    }
```
There are several places where `vault.checkSkewMax` function is called so all such calls should be updated with new signature.
